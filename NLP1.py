Spacy tokenization

splitting text into meaninful sentences and words. (sentence tokenization and word tokenization)


now in sentence tokenization, we need language understanding

for ex, Dr. means Doctor and does not mean sentence ends after Dr.

Example 2: "Let's go to New York !."

"token 1" : "
"token 2" : Let
"token 3": 's
"token 4" : go
"token 5" : to
"token 6" : New
"token 7" : York
"token 8" : !
"token 9" : "

STOP WORDS

In natural language processing (NLP), stop words are commonly occurring words that are often removed from text during preprocessing because they're considered to have little or no semantic value for many NLP tasks.


Common examples: Words like "the," "a," "an," "is," "are," "was," "were," "in,"
 "on," "at," "to," "of," "for," "with," "by," "from," "as," "it," "they," "them",
 "he," "she," "his," "her," "you," "me," "my," "I," "we," "our," and so on are often considered stop words.

Observations

Words that are different in stemming and lemmatization are:

painting
likely
children
ate
fishing
As Stemming achieves the base word by removing the suffixes [ing, ly etc], so it successfully\ 
 
 transform the words like 'painting', 'likely', 'fishing' and lemmatization fails for some words ending with suffixes here.

As Lemmatization uses the dictionary meanings while converting to the base form, 

so words like 'children' and 'ate' are successfully transformed and stemming fails here.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

TERM FREQUENCY 
TF stands for Term Frequency and denotes the ratio of number of times a particular word appeared in a Document to total number of words in the document.

Term Frequency(TF) = [number of times word appeared / total no of words in a document]
Term Frequency values ranges between 0 and 1.
If a word occurs more number of times, then it's value will be close to 1.


IDF, or Inverse Document Frequency, measures how rare a word is across a set of documents. 
A high IDF means a word is uncommon and likely more informative, 
while a low IDF means a word is frequent and probably less informative.

Think of it like this: words like "the" or "is" appear in almost every document, 
so they don't tell you much about the specific content of a particular document. But a word like "algorithm" or "quantum" is much rarer, so if it appears in a document, it's a strong indicator of what the document is about. IDF captures this distinction.

DF stands for Inverse Document Frequency and denotes the
log of ratio of total number of documents/datapoints in the whole dataset to the number of documents that contains the particular word.

Inverse Document Frequency(IDF) = 
[log(Total number of documents / number of documents that contains the word)]

In IDF, if a word occured in more number of documents and is common across all documents, then it's value will be less and ratio will approaches to 0.

Finally:

   TF-IDF = Term Frequency(TF) * Inverse Document Frequency(IDF)

BAG OF WORDS

Imagine you have a bag of words, literally. You reach in and pull out words one by one, but you don't care about the order in which you pull them out. You just count how many times each word appears. That's essentially what the "Bag of Words" model does in NLP.

It represents text as a collection (or "bag") of individual words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequency.

Example:

Sentence 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Sentence 2: "The dog barked at the quick fox."

Bag of Words representation:

Word	Sentence 1	Sentence 2
the	2	2
quick	1	        1
brown	1	        0
fox	1	1
jumps	1	        0
over	1	        0
lazy	1	        0
dog	1	1
barked	0	        1
at	    0	        1

Now zoom out, and think for heavier corpus : books, articles, etc

Limitations  : 

Vocabulary(article,book) is long, if 100k tokens, then each vector 
for each article will be around 100k
better than one hot encoding, because it will add lot more dimensions

It is mostly sparse presentation (most of the elements in vector are 0)
consumes lot of memory
does not capture the meaning, we only take word count

numeric representation , that's all
